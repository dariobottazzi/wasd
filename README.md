wasd, serviceâ†”machine discovery
===============================


Usage
-----

- This service ingests Cassandra rings and DNS records across multiple sites at a regular interval, then exposes information about hosts and services.

- One can ask what a host does, optionally for which sites; which hosts in a site offer a service; which hosts offer a service for a site.

- Queries follow a simple REST API documented in `API`. Answers are serialized in JSON.

- The configuration is handled by typesafe's config; we recommend putting an `application.conf` in the classpath of the service.


Status
------

- Our command line clients are not ready for public distribution.

- Public documentation is lacking.

- Patches are welcome.
